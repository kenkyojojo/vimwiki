The two important features of HPR are:

1. Automatic Network Routing (ANR) on intermediate nodes
    ANR is designed to function on the intermediate nodes along the transport path, routing data quickly and efficiently from one link to another, without regard to session awareness.

2. Rapid Transport Protocol (RTP) on endpoints
    RTP is implemented in the endpoints of a connection, providing error recovery from packet loss and support of control flows between endpoints. It does have session awareness.
