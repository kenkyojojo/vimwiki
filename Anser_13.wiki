13. **Configure autofs to automount the home directories of LDAP users as follows(this is for desktop[VM alias] configuration):
     classroom.example.com NFS-exports /home/guests to your system. This filesystem contains a pre-configured home directory for the user ldapuserX
     ldapuserX's home directory is classroom.example.com:/home/guests/ldapuserX
     ldapuserX's home directory should be automounted locally beneath /netdir as /home/guests/ldapuserX
     home directories must be writable by their users
     ldapuserX's password is password.
    
# yum -y install autofs
# vim /etc/auto.master.d/home.autofs
/home/guests          /etc/auto.home
:x!

# vim /etc/auto.home
*               classroom.example.com:/home/guests/&
:x!

# systemctl restart autofs
# systemctl enable autofs

使用ldapuser測試，登入後有看到home directory即成功
# ssh ldapuserX@localhost
