* Enterprise Extender’s main objective is to carry SNA traffic over an IP network without requiring changes to that network, it must treat the IP network as a particular type of SNA logical connection. 
* The UDP protocol was chosen as the method of transporting network layer packets (NLPs). 
UDP packets provide a way to distinguish EE IP traffic from other types of IP traffic because they contain port numbers. The use of port numbers also permits a priority scheme to be implemented independent of the type of service bits, because many routers are able to prioritize traffic based on the received port number. 
* UDP also has low overhead because it does not concern itself with error recovery or flow control. Recovery and flow control are the responsibility of the EE endpoints (partners). 
* EE exploits the robust error recovery and congestion flow control algorithms of APPN’s HPR.

There are four categories of definitions needed for VTAM:
 1. Start options
 2. EE XCA major node
 3. Model PU major node definition
 4. Switched major node definitions
 
There are three definitions needed for the TCP/IP stack profile:
 1. A static VIPA for EE partner communication
 2. The IUTSAMEH Device for VTAM-to-TCP/IP communication
 3. A port reservation for the EE ports


The following benefits of using EE are discussed in this section:
 * Maintains integrity of SNA data across the IP network
 * EE can use any IP interface supported by the TCP/IP stack
 * Connection Network support
 * Improvements upon LLC2 error handling
 * EE is an effective replacement of SNA/SNI
 * Failure protection better than native IP
 * Failure recovery better than DLSw
 * Supports multinode persistent sessions (MNPS)
 * UDP port numbers mapped to transmission priority
 * Class of Service priority support (COS)
 * Flow and congestion control
 * Flexibility and simplification
 * Support for IPv4 and IPv6 addressing models
 * Compatibility with IPSec and SNA session-level encryption (SLE)
